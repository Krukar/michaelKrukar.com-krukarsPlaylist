- Macbook Pro, Firefox 13.01 (This is really old): Nothing works -  FIXED by updating firefox

October 2, 2014	- Released Candidate 1.02
- All: When you sort the active song, the active song is off
- All: Delete active song, still plays - FIXED by adding an if statement as soon as you remove song
- All: If you localStorage.clear(); and do not refresh the page it will screw up generating a new key. I don't think this a real issue but should be worth noting
- All: Does not save when you reorder a list, but will save next time there's a call to the storeLocally function
